## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure my code or software is functional by testing and debugging. Adding tests to code will show me any errors stemming from issues with the code or missing requirements.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs can be interpreted by asking questions about anything that I don't understand. Getting all of the information before starting to code is very important to ensure everything lines up with requirements.
I will also map out a detailed plan based on requirements that may change as the code is developed. As long as the end goal and requirements stay true to the project, everything should come out correctly.

## How do I approach designing software?
I try to follow the SDLC guidelines while coding. Everything should be created with best practices in mind.
